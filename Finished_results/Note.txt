Remeber these final results

one is familie plots we on a single IGBT and Diode, we can ignore them.

The another results are alle so alle load profiles which are added up and then multiplied by 50 cause so we have 50 switches in parallel cause I want to show a inverter.

Now the last  number which is 1,1.5 and 2 which just multiplied the total load profiles with these factors and also clipping it to the max value so that max IGBT
does not get above 11500.

But as factor is bigger hence the life reduction can be bigger. We can show factor 2 results are the final results in the paper and build a economical model 
around it.

Other than we  can carry out simple constant power simulation to show how different shares of reactive power effect the life of IGBT and Diode.
The S remains at rated power and the porportion of P and Q from min to max.
Somehow add this to different values of S.

So S can be from min to max where max is rated and min is zero.between 10 different points so 0.1 S, 0.2 S to 1.0 S, and for each of those S values give be 
different proportion of P and Q from min max so with this you will be able to show whole range of switch life shown and prove it this 
is how actual life of Inverter works.

Then in paper we can show the final results which I discussed above (Factor 2) and then we are done.
