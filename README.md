# ‚ö° Electro-Thermal Lifetime Assessment for Inverter Semiconductors (IGBTs and Diodes)

A comprehensive **Python-based electro‚Äìthermal lifetime modeling framework** for inverter semiconductor devices.  
It quantifies semiconductor degradation and reliability under realistic mission profiles using coupled electrical‚Äìthermal modeling and empirical lifetime estimation (LESIT model).

## üß≠ Overview
This framework estimates **IGBT and diode lifetime degradation** in grid-forming and grid-following inverters under various loading and power factor conditions.

The model:
- Computes **electrical losses** (switching and conduction) per cycle.  
- Simulates **thermal behavior** using a Foster RC network.  
- Applies **LESIT-based empirical lifetime models** combined with Miner‚Äôs damage accumulation.  
- Includes **Monte Carlo‚Äìbased uncertainty propagation** for probabilistic reliability estimation.
